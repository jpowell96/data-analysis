Post Title:
One of my goals this year is to improve my SQL skills. I purchased a subscription to Datacamp, an online learning platform focused on data skills. I've taken a few courses from basic SQL joins, to data analysis, to window functions. Now, I did a mini data analysis project to exercise my learnings.



Notes:
Create a database
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset


psql
CREATE DATABASE sales_db;
\l  --list all the databases
psql -d sales_db


-- Create the table, then copy data into it
-- create_sales.sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
id bigserial,
ship_mode TEXT,
segment TEXT,
country TEXT,
city TEXT,
state TEXT,
postal_code TEXT, 
region TEXT,
category TEXT,
sub_category TEXT,
sales BIGINT,
quantity BIGINT,
discount FLOAT,
profit NUMERIC);

psql -d sales_db -f create_sales_table.sql

Check out the data types for the table by looking at info_schema.columns:
sales_db=# SELECT column_name , data_type , is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_catalog = 'sales_db'
AND table_name = 'sales';


Tried to copy the data over, but my sales column was a bigint instead of a numeric type.

ALTER TABLE sales ALTER COLUMN sales TYPE NUMERIC;

Check out the data types for the table by looking at info_schema.columns:
sales_db=# SELECT column_name , data_type , is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_catalog = 'sales_db'
AND table_name = 'sales';

Checked again and now I have the correct data type. 

COPY sales(ship_mode,
segment,
country,
city,
state,
postal_code, 
region,
category,
sub_category,
sales,
quantity,
discount,
profit)
FROM '/Users/jjpowell/projects/data-analysis/SampleSuperstore.csv' (DELIMITER ',', FORMAT csv, HEADER false);

-- Questions to Answer from Sales Data:

-- Give me the highest profit city for each state in the dataset
WITH ranked_profits_by_state_city AS (
	select state, city, sum(profit), 
	RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY state ORDER BY sum(profit) DESC) as rank  
	FROM sales GROUP BY state, city ORDER BY state, rank)

SELECT state, city, sum FROM 
ranked_profits_by_state_city
WHERE rank = 1;

-- Across all sales, how are sales split across segments
select segment, COUNT(*) AS sales_by_segment, ROUND(COUNT(*) :: NUMERIC / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales), 2) * 100 || '%'  AS pct_of_sales  
FROM sales GROUP BY segment;

-- For each category and subcategory show me how many sales are for the category
SELECT 
region,
category, 
COUNT(*) as total_sales
FROM sales GROUP BY ROLLUP(region, category, sub_category)
ORDER BY region ASC, category ASC, sub_category ASC NULLS FIRST;


SELECT 
region,
category, 
COUNT(*) as total_sales,
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY COUNT(*)) as rank
FROM sales GROUP BY ROLLUP(region, category)
ORDER BY region NULLS FIRST, category);

-- How did sales look for each category by region
-- For each region, top 3 categories for each region by sales
SELECT region, 
category, 
SUM(sales) as total_sales, 
RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC) as rank
FROM sales 
GROUP BY ROLLUP(region, category);

-- Give me the profits and losses by category
select category, 
SUM(CASE WHEN profit > 0 THEN profit ELSE 0 END) as profits, 
ABS(SUM(CASE WHEN profit < 0 THEN profit ELSE 0 END)) as losses, 
SUM(profit) as total  
FROM sales GROUP BY category;

-- Ship Mode By Region
SELECT region, ship_mode, COUNT(ship_mode) as sales
FROM sales GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((region), (region, ship_mode)) 
ORDER BY region ASC, sales DESC NULLS FIRST;



SELECT category, 
sub_category, 
COUNT(*) as total_sales,
SUM(profit) as profit
FROM sales 
GROUP BY ROLLUP(category, sub_category)
ORDER BY category ASC NULLS FIRST, sub_category ASC NULLS FIRST;

select state, segment, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY state ORDER BY COUNT(quantity)) as popularity FROM sales GROUP BY state, segment;

 select 
        segment, 
        category, 
        sub_category, 
        SUM(profit) as total_profit,
        SUM(quantity) as units_sold, 
        SUM(profit) / SUM(quantity) :: NUMERIC  as profit_per_unit FROM sales GROUP BY segment, category, sub_category ORDER BY segment, profit_per_unit  DESC;
